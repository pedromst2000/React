## How to start an React project

* npm create vite@latest

````bash
npm create vite@latest
````

After running the command will ask the following questions:

* OK to proceed? (Y) 
* Project name: (react-project)
* Package name: (react-project)
* Select a framework: (Use arrow keys) -> react
* Select a variant: (Use arrow keys) -> TypeScript (For this project we will use TypeScript)

After that, the project will be created and you will see the following message:

```bash
Scaffolding project in /Users/username/Desktop/react-project...
Done. Now run:

  cd react-project
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

`npm install` will install all the dependencies (third party libraries) 

`npm run dev` will start the project and will show the following message:

```bash
  vite v4.3.9  ready in 861 ms

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use --host to expose
  > press h to show help

  ready in 1.03s.
```
